# veg-of-the-year

...things are growing.

This is an 'inventory' app made using express and node.js that monitors what vegetables are in season this month, and display info about those vegetables and the months themselves in a simple and clean fashion.

This was made to learn CRUD actions on a database, from a node.js web app.

(First time loading will be slow, as it's hosted on Heroku.)

There is photo adding and CRUD actions, but only for TRUSTED USERS.
